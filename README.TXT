#This program allows users to manipulate a network of members by adding,
# removing, searching and displaying members. The program starts by prompting the user to enter two data files, one
# for profile information and the other for connection information. The program then initializes the data
# and stores it into lists. After that, it displays a menu to the user and based on the user's selection,
# the program will execute the appropriate command. The possible commands include displaying member information,
# listing the number of a member's friends, listing the friends of a member, displaying the graph of the network,
# recommending a friend to a member, searching for members from a particular country and saving the changes.
# Finally, the program exits when the user selects the exit option.
